Chosen data version:
    Gropuing the data by products and week. Meaning we predict the expected revenue for every given week. This dataset works better than the day by day. 
    The user can set:
        Category
            Electronics
            Furniture
            Groceries
            Clothing
        Price
        Discount percentage
        Marketing spending
        holiday effect
            True or false, whether there was a holiday effect that week    
    

What values should the different QR codes mean? For this lets use the weekly averages in the data as well as standard deviations:
    Price
        mean: 453.69
        sd: 289.9
        max: 970.21
    Discount   
        mean: 2.99
        sd: 2.4
        max: 20.0
    Marketing spending
        mean: 341.3
        sd: 171.9
        max: 1005
    Values above max should not be available to users, as the model has no idea what to do with them. Meaning values above the max won't change the prediciton. 

API documentation:
    Predictions are produced by the Prediction() class, inside /Backend/API
    The API server is started by running manage.py runserver 9000. Make sure to include 9000 to set the port of he server to 9000
    When the server is started it initializes the Prediction() class. On init Prediction() loads the model.
    API requests are sent to http://127.0.0.1:9000/api/request/. The server expects a POST httprequest, that has as its body the set of chosen parameters (for formatting see example.json).
    The API then returns the result of the prediction in the format: {'prediction': prediction}

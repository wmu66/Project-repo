Two possible versions of dealng with the data:
    By day-to-day: We predict the expected revenue for every day in the retail shop, for a given product. The user can set:
        Category
            Electronics
            Furniture
            Groceries
            Clothing
        Price
        Discount percentage
        Marketing spending
        day
            The day of the week
        holiday effect
            True or false, whether there is a holiday effect

Alternative version:
    Gropuing the data by products and week. Meaning we predict the expected revenue for every given week. This dataset works better than the day by day. 
    The user can set:
        Category
            Electronics
            Furniture
            Groceries
            Clothing
        Price
        Discount percentage
        Marketing spending
        holiday effect
            True or false, whether there was a holiday effect that week    
    
I also tried to group by product. So predicting revenue for every product. However, the databse contains only 42 products, so not enough data to be able to fit a model. 

What values should the different QR codes mean? For this lets use the weekly averages in the data as well as standard deviations:
    Price
        mean: 453.69
        sd: 289.9
    Discount   
        mean: 2.99
        sd: 2.4
    Marketing spending
        mean: 341.3
        sd: 171.9
